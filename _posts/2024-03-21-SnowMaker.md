## Project

This was a project that was done for fun using HTML, CSS, Flask, Python (BeautifulSoup, APScheduler) and Bootstrap.

It will scrape snow data from Sunday River and Sugarloaf ski resort websites and then display it using Python's BeautifulSoup.

It will also run every hour using Python's APScheduler.
