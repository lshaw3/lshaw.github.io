## Project

This was a project that was done for fun using HTML, CSS, Flask (SQLAlchemy), Python, and Bootstrap.

This webpage uses a database to store the value of a counter which you can increment, decrement, and reset using the buttons.
This was good practice getting used to using databases to store information.
